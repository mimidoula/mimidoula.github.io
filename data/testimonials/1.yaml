text: "Dianne was present as the doula during my first birth, and looking back at that day, her presence is one of the things that stick out most. My plan was to deliver at a birth center, but was unexpectedly transferred to the hospital hours into my labor. Dianne remained so compassionate and supportive through my transfer, and my birth. She communicated with the nurses and made sure all of my needs and wishes were met, while coaching me and caring for me every step of the way. I had a long labor, and she was so comforting and helpful the entire time. I highly recommend her services to any expecting mother!"
