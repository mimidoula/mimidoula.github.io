text: "[Dianne] was everything I needed. She is kind and loving and present. She is strong and aware. She leads you while following your body. Because of her skills and who she is moving in and out of whatever support was needed. At times she was silent and in the 'shadows' but other times her presence was so solid and bold. It was like she was a knowledgeable extension of myself taking me through it all. At every turn she offered what my mind heart body partner and baby needed. I would do it a million times over again with Dianne and would never do it without her."
