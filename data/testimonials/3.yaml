text: "I can't even begin to express the amazing and positive impact Dianne had on the birth of my first baby. Before giving birth, my husband and I loved being educated about all things to do with pregnancy and labor during a set of classes she taught. Her classes taught me so much about the natural and beautiful process of birth, and her vast knowledge of many different types of birthing techniques allowed me to explore and choose what was most helpful for me. I am certain that all the exercises, relaxation practices, and nutritional tips Dianne gave lead to my quick labor!"
