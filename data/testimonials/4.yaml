text: "I would rate Dianne 5 out of 5 stars! She was very professional, and she definitely knew what she was doing. Dianne made me feel comfortable with the process of my wife giving birth, and I am grateful that she was there to help me support my wife. Dianne helped us stick with our goal for my wife to give birth naturally without an epidural. I highly recommend having Dianne there during the birthing process!"
