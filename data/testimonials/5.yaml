text: "Dianne has an incredibly long list of support tools in her doula mind ready for whatever labor throws at the family. She exudes a maternal energy that is warm and comfy. She was so in tune with our needs, and communicated so perfectly with us. She has a magic way of connecting with you on a spiritual level and being exactly what you need.  Our family LOVES Dianne and I could not have had the birth I had without her. She and her kindness will be forever remembered and adored by our family!"
